## 📖 Overview
 The 'Community' project is a coding site construction project that helps beginners who start coding to understand the code easily. By annotating each line of the code written by the user, this project enhances the understanding of the code and visualizes the code to easily explain areas that are not understood only by annotation. And by providing a bulletin board to conduct Q/A between users, you can get help in areas that cannot be understood only by annotation and visualization.

## 🤔 Expectation effectiveness

### (1) Lower barriers to entry to code understanding:

       Through real-time annotation and visualization of code, coding beginners can alleviate the image that it is difficult when learning a programming language for the first time. This can help "corin" who are not good at coding understand the code faster and identify errors.

### (2) Reduce error resolution time:

       Helps Corinne quickly identify and resolve errors that occur while writing code. This improves the productivity of the coding process and reduces the time required to correct errors.

### (3) Developers Share Knowledge:

       Promote a culture in which users share knowledge and help each other through the community. This allows new programmers to utilize abundant data and support systems, and helps them improve their coding skills by cooperating with each other.

### (4) Expand the coding community:
    
       As the barrier to entry to coding is lowered, the scale of the coding community expands. As a result, new ideas and projects develop, and developers from various backgrounds and experiences work together to drive development.
